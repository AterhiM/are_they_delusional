# 🔮 Are They Delusional?

*Because sometimes your "criterias for a partner" exists only in your dreams...*

## About

Ever had that friend who's looking for a 1.80m tall, wealthy partner with the perfect BMI, but somehow "can't find anyone"? Well, now you can scientifically prove whether they're being reasonable or... ***slightly delusional***.

This Streamlit-powered app uses real Moroccan demographic data to calculate the statistical probability of finding a partner matching specific criteria. Think of it as a reality check with a side of data science.

## 🎯 Features

- **Gender-Specific Analysis**: Choose whether you're looking for a male or female partner
- **Age Preferences**: Because age is just a number (until you do the math)
- **Income Requirements**: Find out if your financial expectations are in the right tax bracket
- **Physical Characteristics**: Height, weight, and BMI preferences (with actual Moroccan averages)
- **Match Score**: Get a reality check score from 0% (completely delusional) to 100% (surprisingly reasonable)

## 💭 Why This Exists

Because sometimes people need a gentle (or not so gentle) reminder that:
1. Perfect partners are statistically rare
2. Their standards might need a reality check
3. Math doesn't care about your feelings

## 🚀 Usage

1. Select your target partner's gender.
2. Input your criterias.
3. Get your delusion... err, I mean "match" score.
4. Reflect on your life choices and accept reality.

## 📊 Data Sources

All calculations are based on real Moroccan demographic data, including:
- Age and gender distribution
- Income statistics
- Anthropometric data (height, weight, BMI)
- Ethnic Composition (Arab, Amazigh, Sahrawis)
- Religious Affiliation (Sunni Muslims, Shia Muslims, Jewish, Christians, Baha'is and Other Groups).

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This app is meant to be entertaining while providing statistical insights. It doesn't:
- Account for love, chemistry, or personality.
- Guarantee finding a partner.
- Validate unrealistic expectations.

Remember: Just because something is statistically improbable doesn't mean it's impossible. But maybe, just maybe, you should reconsider if you're looking for a 2m tall neurosurgeon with a six-pack who loves cooking and wants to live with your parents.
